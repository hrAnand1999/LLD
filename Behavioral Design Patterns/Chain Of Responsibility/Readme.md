Understanding => The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern used to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

🔧 Problem Statement
Imagine you're building a system that processes customer support requests. These requests can be of different types: billing, technical, or general inquiries. You want each type of request to be handled by a specific department, but you also want the flexibility to add or remove departments without changing the core logic.

✅ Use Case
1. Customer support systems
2. Event handling systems
3. Middleware in web frameworks
4. Validation pipelines
5. Logging systems
6. ATM/Vending Machines


📌 Applicability
Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when:

1. You want to decouple the request from it's receivers
2. You want multiple object to handle the requeste, without explicitly specifying the handler
3. You want to dynamically change the handler of requests

🔍 How to Identify the Need for This Pattern
Ask yourself:

1. Do you have a series of processing steps that can be executed in order?
2. Can each step decide whether to handle the request or pass it on?
3. Do you want to avoid hardcoding the logic for selecting the handler?
4. If the answer is yes to these, the Chain of Responsibility pattern is likely a good fit.
