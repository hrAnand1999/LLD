# The code is incomplete. The Facade pattern should encapsulate the complexities of the subsystem.
# The ComputerFacade class should implement the excute method to interact with the subsystem components.
# The excute method should create instances of the subsystem components and call their methods.
# The Client class should use the ComputerFacade to perform operations without needing to know the details of the subsystem.
# The above code is a starting point for implementing the Facade pattern.
# The Facade pattern simplifies the interface for the client, allowing it to interact with a complex subsystem easily.
